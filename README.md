# Introduction :
A stopwatch is indeed a portable wristwatch that counts the seconds that have passed between a specific time that it is triggered and the time it is deactivated. A stop clock is a sizable digital stopwatch made for distant viewing, for as at a sports stadium. In manual timing, a button is pressed to start and stop the clock. In a fully automatic time, sensors automatically trigger both starting and stopping.
# Mandatory Modules
A. Using Python
Just no libraries will be utilised in this software; Tkinter will be the only one used for GUI creation.
Tkinter: Tkinter is the name of Python's built-in GUI library. GUI application development is rapid and easy thanks to Python and Tkinter. Tkinter offers an efficient object-oriented interface for the Tk GUI toolkit. GUI is nothing more than a desktop application that gives you an interface to communicate with computers and improves the experience of instructing your code (command-line input). They are employed in PCs, laptops, and other digital equipment, among other things, to carry out various duties.

B. Using ANdroid studio

1.First of all, create a new project and name it. We have named our project ProjectGurukul Stopwatch.

2. After doing so, we will see two files opened.
  
3. After writing the code for activity_main.xml we’ll write the following code in MainActivity.kt file
